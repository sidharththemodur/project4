// File name: Move.asm

// Runs an infinite loop that listens to the keyboard input.
// Draws a 16-by-16 square to the top left corner of the screen.
// When a key is pressed and released (any key), the rectangle is
// moved 16 pixels to the right.

// Challenge versions (please specify if you are doing one of these):
// (Only try these if they sound interesting to you.)
//   - Instead of moving in 16-pixel increments, move in 5-pixel increments.
//   - Instead of moving whenever a key is pressed and released,
//       move gradually while a key is pressed down. <-- doing this one
